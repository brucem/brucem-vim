# My VIM config 

It's a bit of a mess and could be cleaned up but putting it under revision
control should be a step in right direction 

To get started, install homesick:

    gem install homesick

Clone this repo

    homesick clone brucem/brucem-vim

Link it into place

    homesick symlink brucem/brucem-vim
